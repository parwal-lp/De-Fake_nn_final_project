# Neural Networks Final Project
### Implementation of the study: <br> ***"DE-FAKE: Detection and Attribution of Fake Images Generated by Text-to-Image GenerationModels"* <br> by Zeyang Sha, Zheng Li, Ning Yu, Yang Zhang**

**Name**: *Laura Papi*<br>
**Matricola**: *1760732*


# Project Description

The above cited study focuses on the growing concerns about the possible misuse of AI generated images, and assesses the necessity for a tool to detect, and attribute, these fake images.<br>
In particular, it points out the lack of research on the particular case of images generated by a text prompt.
<br>

<br>
Therefore, this research proposes methods to answer the following 3 research questions [RQ]:

- **RQ1**. Detection of images generated by text-to-image generation models

- **RQ2**. Attribution of the fake images to their source model

- **RQ3**. Analysis of the likelihood that different text prompts have to generate authentic images
<br>

Examples for my implementation of the described methods are provided in the [Notebook](Notebook.ipynb)
<br>
The complete implementation of the models can be found in the source directory of this GitHub repository [Source Code](/src)
